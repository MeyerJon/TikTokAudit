# Hunting filter bubbles on TikTok
This project is a WIP. The plan is to conduct an audit study on TikTok's web app and see if any potentially harmful filter bubbles can be measured.

## Planned experiments
In order to work around resource limitations, this audit will be split into multiple smaller experiments, each using 6 bots to examine filter bubbles of 2 topics. Each topic will thus be assigned to 3 bots, which will be operated from my local machines. To limit the influence of confounding factors on personalisation, each 'group' of puppets will have the same demographic features (age & gender). 

#### Round 1
All puppets in this experiment will be registered as 18 year olds.
Three male puppets will be assigned to anti-vaccination content; the other three puppets will be female and assigned to content related to hate speech.
