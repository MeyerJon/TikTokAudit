Tags/Creators/Sounds related to the topics of anti-vaccination and hate speech
Extra remarks:
    - TikTok seems to ignore tag capitalization
    - Might need to add simple filter rules to interpret tags:
       e.g. avax AND (NOT (crypto OR bitcoin))

## Anti-vaccine
Additional notes:
    - From my observations, it feels like it should be possible to build a classifier that can predict 'likelihood of misinformation' for profiles (though it won't fit the scope of this project)
    - Associated descriptors:
        - Political ('conservative', 'patriot', flag emoji ...) (seems like the top videos are mostly american)
        - Parenthood (mostly mothers, often mentioned in user bio)
    - Associated with political content (so conservative tags can also bring us here)
    - Vaccine often refered to as the 'jab' - might help identify actual antivax content
    - TikTok seems to add disclaimer banners on various videos, but it doesn't seem very consistent
    - Some of the tags below might have been banned by now (e.g. antivax)
    
[TAGS]
  - pureblood (mostly Harry Potter content, but also used by unvaccinated people as a moniker)
  - antivax(x) (more often used ironically) ('antivax' has been banned)

  - nopoke
  - nojab
  - novaxclan (also a fornite creator)
  - novax

  - nomask
  - unmask (-ourkids) (-ourchildren)
  - unvaccinated
